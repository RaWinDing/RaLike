  If you want to use RaLike to compete similarity between two text files, you
should do according to the folowing:

  1st step: You should input "keyword", then input the ADDRESS of keywords.
  2st step: You should input "first", then input the ADDRESS of first file.
  3st step: You should input "second", then input the ADDRESS of second file.
  4st step: Input "run", then you can see the result. But if you did not input
          the all infomation, you may get "Error".

  Pay attention: if you input the address of file by mistake, you may get the
wrong result. It's maybe "Of course!", but in fact, you should get "Error".
Sorry, I admit my mistake. So you should pay attention to avoiding input by
mistake, because I have no time to modify this application.
